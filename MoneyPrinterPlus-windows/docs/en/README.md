You can also enable video transition effects. Currently, 30+ transition effects are supported.

![image-20240612140830765](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406121408177.png)

> Local video resource usage will be supported in the future.

#### Subtitle Configuration

The subtitle files are located in the fonts folder at the project root.

Currently, two font collections are supported: Songti and Pingfang.

![image-20240612141000542](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406121410773.png)

You can choose the subtitle position, color, border color, and border width.

#### Video Generation

Finally, click the "Generate Video" button to create the video.

The page will display the specific steps and progress.

![image-20240612141446057](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud


## Batch Video Splicing

After the video is generated, it will be displayed at the bottom, and you can directly play and watch the effect.

![image-20240612141532280](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406121415214.png)

## 2. Batch Video Splicing

After starting the project, you can find the video splicing area in the upper left corner.

Click on it to enter the page of the batch video splicing tool.

In the video splicing area, we can configure up to 5 video segments.

You can control the number of segments by clicking "Add Segment" or "Delete Segment".

![image-20240628093854842](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406280938023.png)

### What Are Video Segments?

Some friends might ask, what are video segments?

A long video cannot have only one video theme. For example, the first half of your video may be about the style of clothing, and the second half may be about the material of the clothing.

So, the clothing style is segment 1, and the material is segment 2.

What we need to do is collect material for clothing style, which can be an mp4 video or jpg, png, and other image resources. The resolution should be as high as possible, otherwise the quality of the generated video may not be very good.

Then, put the material for the clothing style in the resource directory of video segment 1.

For example, in the resource directory shown in the image:

```bash
d:\downloads\work\scen1
```

Similarly, we put the material for the clothing material in the resource directory of video segment 2.

As shown below:

![image-20240628094702252](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406280947354.png)

What are video resource texts?

Video resource texts are the textual descriptions you need to associate with the video segment.

You can prepare many texts for a segment, and then put these texts in a txt file. One text per line in the txt file.

The system will randomly select a line from the txt file as the final textual description of the video segment.

Below is an example of a text file:

```txt
Accurate cutting, smooth lines, the design of this vest perfectly fits the body shape, whether it is loose or slim, it can show your elegant posture.
Our designers perfectly blend classic and modern styles. Every line and every cut is to showcase your unique body shape.
Every precise cut is carefully calculated to create the most suitable style for your body. From the shoulder line to the waist cut, each part showcases your unique style.
Accurate cutting, smooth lines, the design of this vest is intended to make every wearer feel the tailored fit.
Accurate cutting, smooth lines, the design of this vest fits perfectly, showing elegant posture whether it's loose or slim.
Designers blend classic and modern styles, every line and cut showcases a unique body shape.
Every precise cut is carefully calculated to create a style that suits your body shape, showcasing a unique style from the shoulder line to the waist cut.
Accurate cutting and smooth lines, the vest design is aimed at a tailored fit, showcasing the wearer's personal charm.
```

Configure your video segment with the video resource and resource texts.

### Video Dubbing Area

In the video dubbing area, you can select the dubbing language and the corresponding dubbing language. Currently, it supports 100+ dubbing languages.

You can also select different dubbing speeds to support different usage scenarios.

![image-20240616220840076](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406162208006.png)

If you are unsure about the dubbing, you can click on "Try to Listen" to listen to the corresponding dubbing voice.

### Background Music

The background music is placed in the "bgmusic" directory under the project. You can add background music files to this folder as needed.

![image-20240616221041774](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406162210686.png)

You can choose whether to enable background music and the default background music volume.

### Video Configuration Area

In the video configuration area, you can choose the video layout: portrait, landscape, or square.

You can choose the video frame rate, video size, and the minimum and maximum length of each video segment.

Most importantly, you can also enable video transition effects. Currently, it supports 30+ video transition effects.

![image-20240616221116997](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406162211618.png)

### Subtitle Configuration

If you need subtitles, you can click to enable the subtitle option, and set the subtitle font, subtitle font size, and subtitle color, etc.

If you are unsure how to set it, you can choose the default settings.

![image-20240616221242812](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406162212891.png)

### Final Video Generation

The system currently supports generating up to 100 videos at a time, according to your needs.

![image-20240628095137565](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406280951343.png)

Finally, click the "Generate Video" button to generate the video.

The page will show the corresponding progress.

![image-20240616221712173](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202406162217977.png)

The generated videos will be displayed at the bottom of the page, and you can play them as needed.

If you have generated multiple videos, you can find them in the "final" directory of the project folder.

## 3. Batch Short Video Upload

### Working Principle

The automatic publishing tool is essentially based on the selenium automation framework.

By simulating human click operations, it can complete most tasks that would otherwise require manual operation. This frees up your hands.

Additionally, there are two ways to implement this automation. One is to start a browser while running the program. The other is to attach to an existing browser to operate on its page.

This tool chooses to attach to an existing browser.

This is mainly because some video platforms require scanning a QR code with a mobile phone to log in, and it is difficult to simulate this login process in the program.

### Prerequisites

Currently, automatic publishing supports two browsers: Chrome and Firefox. You can choose one according to your needs.

#### 1. Chrome Configuration

The current mainstream browser is undoubtedly Chrome. So, let's first talk about how to support Chrome.

1. First, you need to download and install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Remember your version number. You can download Chrome from the official website or from this page [ChromeDriver download page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

2. You need to download the corresponding ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version from the [ChromeDriver download page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/). Make sure you download the version that matches your operating system and Chrome version.

After downloading, unzip the ChromeDriver to a local directory. It's best not to use a directory path with Chinese characters, as it may not run properly.

3. Start Chrome in debug mode.

If you are using a Mac, you can first set an alias for Chrome:

```bash
alias chrome="/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome"
```

Start Chrome in debug mode:

```bash
chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

If you are using Windows, you can add the following to the target of the Chrome desktop shortcut:

```txt
--remote-debugging-port=9222
```

![image-20240710103643535](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202407101036374.png)

Then double-click to open Chrome in debug mode.

#### 2. Firefox Configuration

Apart from Chrome, the most commonly used browser is probably Firefox.

So, we also provide support for Firefox.

To use Firefox, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

2. Download the [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) driver. Download the geckodriver that matches your Firefox browser version. Make sure you download the version that matches your operating system and Firefox version.

After downloading, unzip the geckodriver to a local directory. It's best not to use a directory path with Chinese characters, as it may not run properly.

3. Start Firefox in debug mode:

Similar to Chrome, you need to start Firefox with the following command: `-marionette -start-debugger-server 2828`

![image-20240504120509315](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202405041205192.png)

> Note: The port here must be 2828 and cannot be customized.

Now, if you open Firefox, you will see that the navigation bar turns red, indicating that you have started remote debugging mode.

![image-20240504120607831](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202405041206516.png)

Enter `about:config` to see that the marionette.port port is 2828.

### Getting Started

In a Windows environment, simply double-click "start.bat" to start.

In a Mac environment, execute "sh start.sh" in the project root directory.

The browser will automatically open the MoneyPrinterPlus homepage.

![image-20240710104233733](https://flydean-1301049335.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/202407101042103.png)

Click on the "Video Automatic Publishing Tool" on the left to access the page for the video automatic publishing tool.

You can select the driver type, Chrome or Firefox.

The driver location is the location of the previously downloaded chromedirver or geckodriver.

The video content directory is the directory where your video content is located.

After modifying the video directory, the video files and text files in the video directory will be automatically listed.

The video files are the content you want to publish.

What about the text files?

The text files are the textual content associated with the video.

For example, if you want to publish a video about Tang poetry, the corresponding content of the text file would be:

```txt
Wang Wei: To Guo Geshi
The high pavilion door is covered in lingering light, with peach and plum trees shading and willow catkins flying.
The sparse bells in the forbidden palace chime late, and the crying birds in the provincial office are rare.
Morning shakes the jade pendants and rushes to the golden palace, while evening offers the heavenly book and bows in the imperial hall.
I want to accompany you without growing old, and I'll lay down my morning attire due to illness.

The video site configuration should be quite straightforward, and friends who have been to kindergarten should understand it.

Title Prefix: If you need to add an additional prefix to the video title, you can set it here.

Collection Name: Some video sites require you to select a collection. This is the name of the collection (the program will not create the collection for you, so you need to create it in advance on the website).

Video Tags: It's self-explanatory, it's the tags, separated by spaces.

For Kuaishou, there is an additional field configuration.

You can choose whether to enable Douyin, Kuaishou, Video Number, or Little Red Book.

### Environment Check

Next, you can prepare to publish the video.

But before publishing, you can click on "Environment Check".

If your homepage opens automatically, it means your environment configuration is fine. You can go ahead and publish the video.

### Publishing Video

Because all video sites require login, you need to open the corresponding site and log in to your account first before clicking the "Publish Video" button.

Once all your accounts are logged in, click the "Publish Video" button.

Start your journey of freedom.

The running interface will look something like this:
